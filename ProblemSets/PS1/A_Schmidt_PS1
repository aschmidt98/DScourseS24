\section{Introduction}

I am a second year PhD student in the PCoB Marketing and Supply Chain Management Division. I am interested in Economics because I perceive it as the simplified and objective model of Marketing thought, so it's kind of like an intellectual cousin I want to get to know better. I also think Data Science will be helpful in my research- my advisor essentially only published conceptual papers, and I don't want schools afterwards to think my skill set is limited by that. As a result, I feel it would be wise to study some other methods that reinforce my flexibility.

For my project, I have a long list of research ideas I'd like to tackle, but I think my biggest hurdle is getting data. Learning to find and clean datasets from publically avaialble information might help me approach some of them. 

After school, I'd like to teach at a university, although I'm not "locked in" enough into my research to know where yet.
